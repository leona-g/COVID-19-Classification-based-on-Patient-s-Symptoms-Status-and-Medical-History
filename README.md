# COVID-19-Classification-based-on-Patient-s-Symptoms-Status-and-Medical-History

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on global healthcare systems, necessitating rapid and accurate identification of infected individuals for effective disease management. This research paper presents an analysis of a COVID-19 dataset comprising information on patients' symptoms, status, and medical history. The primary objective is to investigate the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Linear Regression, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, in predicting COVID-19 outcomes based on the provided dataset. The study involved preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values and standardize features. We then split the data into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the performance of each algorithm. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to assess the predictive capabilities of the models. The selected machine learning algorithms, KNN, DT, LR, SVM, and Gradient Boosting, are implemented to build predictive models. 
Decision Tree achieved the highest accuracy (95.5%) and precision (100%), while maintaining a high recall (91%) and F1 score (95.3%), while Gradient boosting, Linear Regression and Random Forest achieved an accuracy of 95.61% and an F1 score of 0.96. SVM also performed well with an accuracy of 88.46%. The findings highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm and provide insights into their suitability for COVID-19 outcome prediction based on the provided patient data. The findings can assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions, such as resource allocation and patient management strategies, during the ongoing pandemic. The analysis highlights their potential for supporting decision-making in healthcare settings and provides valuable insights for further research and development in the field of COVID-19 data analysis.
